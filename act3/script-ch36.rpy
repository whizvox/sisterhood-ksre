        "She's a girl with a slim figure and a slightly delicate posture. Her hair, which is even darker than my own, reaches just past her shoulders, and her long bangs are not completely unlike mine. I can't say she looks familiar to me. Does this person know me or something?"

        "There's no doubt in my mind that this girl is talking about Hisao. What are the odds of us running into someone from his old school?"
        "Well, according to Hisao this place is rather close to his old high school, so I suppose the odds of us running into students from there aren't impossibly low, especially since it's summer break."

        ha "I... t-think we're t-talking about the same p-person, but..."
        "I can't help but grimace as the girl's logic suddenly hits me. I already know that she's aware of Yamaku being a school. Chances are that she also knows what kind of school it is."
        "In that case, she probably decided to take her chances because it was a girl with severe facial scarring who was bringing up Hisao's name."
        "The idea that I can be this easily identified as a Yamaku student in this way, even when I'm out of my school uniform, feels like a painful blow to the gut. The girl, who is eyeing me pretty closely, looks slightly worried."
        gi "Is something wrong?"
        "I quickly brush off her concerns. I don't think there's a need for me to bring up my insecurity about my scars."
        ha "It's n-nothing. Ummm... so... y-you were f-friends with Hisao?"

        gi "We were... in the same class."
        "Hisao, during one of our get-togethers in the city, confided in me that there were only three people he used to hang out with on a regular basis before he moved to Yamaku, and it doesn't seem like this girl was one of them. Simply a former classmate then?"
        ha "Oh."
        "But there's something that doesn't make sense to me. Why is she having this tortured discussion with me? If she overheard his name, she must have heard our booth number as well. Why didn't she just take a peek inside and simply apologize if the person inside wasn't who she was expecting?"
        ha "Ummm... Are y-you g-going to say hello to him?"

But judging from the way they went their separate ways and the fact that he never ended up sending a reply to that letter, it's equally likely that a confrontation would be excruciatingly awkward.
