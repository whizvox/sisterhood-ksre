        "Now that I'm fully awake, I recognize the room I'm in. This is the living room of Hisao's home, and the sound of bowls and dishes being placed on a table coming from behind me, mixed in with the occasional sound of soft humming, tells me that it was Hisao's mother who came in here earlier."

        n "It's been two days since Hisao and I returned from Scotland. We were pretty exhausted when we finally made it back to Yamaku, especially since there was no Akira to give us a ride this time. When we reached our dorm rooms we pretty much hit the sack immediately."
        n "Hisao spent most of yesterday getting his biological clock back on schedule while I spent most of the day behind the computer in the newspaper club's archive room downloading photos off my camera, burning them to CD, and getting my favorite ones printed out."
        n "Late in the afternoon we boarded the train to the Nakai home, and we managed to get there before Hisao's parents. When they came home later that evening, they were both happy to see him again, and they were pretty friendly to me as well. Hisao spent the remainder of the evening showing his parents a selection of the pictures we took and telling them about our vacation in Inverness."

        n "The last time I met Hisao's parents, shortly after Hisao and I succesfully salvaged our relationship, I only stayed long enough to introduce myself and sit by Hisao's side for a few minutes while his parents were busy digesting the news that their son had been dating."
        n "{vspace=30}I was a bit apprehensive about spending an extended amount of time around his parents, but my curiosity about his life before Yamaku overrode my social anxiety, and if his parents were put off by my shy and awkward behavior last night, they didn't really show it."
        n "Of course, neither of us had any interest in telling his parents about the more intimate aspect of our relationship and Hisao made sure not to disclose the fact that he and I shared a bed during our stay in Scotland, so we both kept our mouth shut when Hisao's parents said I could sleep on the couch in the living room when it was time to go to bed."
        n "I guess I shouldn't complain; the couch was a soft and very comfortable sleeping spot, but I still would have preferred to spend the night together with my boyfriend."

        him "Good morning, dear. Did you sleep well?"
        hid "Quite well. Is... ah... Hanako still asleep?"
        him "I think she is, so let's keep our voices down a bit so we don't wake her up."
        "I hear Hisao's father let out a sleepy yawn."
        hid "Well, it was a short night."
        him "But you have to admit it's a special occasion when our son not only returns home for the first time since his transfer, but also brings his girlfriend along and souvenirs and photos from a vacation on the other side of the world."
        hid "Yes, it's nice he'll be staying for a whole week. I was beginning to wonder if he had forgotten about us."
        "Hisao's mother lets out a chuckle."
        him "That's not very nice, dear. He has called us twice during the weeks after his hospitalisation, and he also sent us a text message to let us know that he and his friends arrived safely in Scotland."
        hid "Well, I can't deny he has been improving lately."
        him "He's been through a lot this year, and I think he simply needed some time to learn that good things still can and do happen to him despite his condition. I think he's starting to realize that."
        him "While he was in the hospital he grew so distant from everyone, but last night while he was talking about their vacation it was almost like his heart attack never took place."
        him "Maybe that's also because there's a girl in his life now. When he called me yesterday, he said that she was curious about his life before transferring to Yamaku. I'm willing to bet that played a big part in his decision to come over."
        hid "It's reassuring to know that she has a good influence on him."
        "I silently smile a bit. It sounds like they approve of me dating their son. That makes me very happy and a bit relieved as well."
        "Dating someone is tough when his parents don't like you, and I don't think I'd be able to deal with disapproval of that kind. I still feel a bit ashamed that I wasn't even there for Hisao during his last hospitalisation."
        "I hear a snicker."
        hid "I got the impression last time that he has become quite the ladies' man. When we reached the dorm building last time there were no less than three young ladies waiting there to welcome him back. No wonder he didn't want to come home with us that day."
        hid "While he was introducing them to us I was actually wondering if he was perhaps seeing one of them."
        him "That's what I also wondered about back then, but I couldn't really decide at the time which one of them was the more likely possibility."
        hid "You mean you weren't sure what type of girl he was most likely to go for?"
        him "If Hanako had been there with those other three at the beginning I think it would have been easy. When he came into that teahouse with her in tow, I immediately had a hunch he wasn't going to introduce us to simply another friend. That was before I even noticed he was holding her hand."
        hid "A hunch?"
        him "Do you remember back when Hisao was still in the hospital and there was this dark-haired girl who dropped by several times during the first few weeks? Hanako reminds me a little bit of her."
        hid "Yes, I remember. What was her name again?"
        him "I'm not completely sure anymore, but I believe her name sounded a little bit like Hanako's."
        hid "They weren't that similar, were they? If that other girl had been even only half as shy as Hanako, I'd probably remember that."
        "My smile immediately drops upon hearing that."
        "I know I'm really shy. I'm trying not to be, but I'm still having a hard time relaxing around Hisao's parents, probably for no other reason than the fact that they're my boyfriend's parents."
        "I let Hisao do most of the talking last night and had been hoping that they wouldn't have paid attention to the fact that I barely said a word. Looks like they noticed after all."
        "Finding out that Hisao's parents might have been put off by my timidity has left a bad feeling in my stomach. I pray that this conversation isn't going to end with them agreeing that it would have been better if Hisao had picked up Lilly or Shizune as a girlfriend instead of me."
        him "I'm not saying they were extremely similar, but I do feel they shared a few superficial traits. Dark and fairly long hair, kind of girlish, and coming across as just a little bit delicate. I wouldn't be surprised if those traits are what Hisao finds attractive in a girl."
        hid "You're acting like that girl from the hospital was a girlfriend, but Hisao insisted she was merely a classmate."
        "Hisao's mother chuckles playfully."
        him "Did you believe him when he said that? The few classmates that visited only did so once or twice the first week. And Hisao never mentioned her before as someone he hung out with."
        hid "Well, if there was a relationship before his condition was first triggered, I don't think it lasted throughout his hospital stay."
        him "I don't think so, either. I doubt it was just us he grew distant from over those months."
        "Although I realize that eavesdropping isn't very lady-like, this conversation is very interesting, and I strain to hear more without alerting them to the fact that I'm already awake."
        "However, my attempt at listening in is suddenly cut short."

        ha "Ummm..."
        "I once again feel his finger trace a shape on my back, but it's not a heart this time. It takes me a moment to realize he's using his finger to spell out a word. I close my eyes, trying to visualize the sensation."
