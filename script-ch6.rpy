hi "Hanako. Are you still awake?"
ha "I… had a bad dream just now. I couldn't get back to sleep right away. Then I heard you tossing and turning."
hi "Sorry about that."
ha "You don't have to apologize."
"…"
"A silence."
"Should I try to talk to Hisao some more, or would he dislike being kept awake?"
"This is the second consecutive night we spent sleeping in the same bedroom—a result of Lilly's match making mood. I was given the double bed Lilly's parents must have used in the past, while Hisao has been using the smaller bed in the corner."
ha "H-Hisao, d-do you want to talk for a bit?"
hi "Sure."

"I'm wondering if Hisao is thinking about the same thing I am right now."
"Even though we're girlfriend and boyfriend, we're currently not exactly acting as a couple. Are we supposed to right now?"
ha "Umm… I w-wouldn't mind if you got a little closer."
hi "Like sit on the edge of your bed? That would indeed make talking a little bit easier."
ha "Y-you c-can lie n-next to m-me, if you want."
hi "I-if you don't mind."

"I hear the sound of shuffling steps slowly coming closer."
"Due to the heavy curtains covering the windows and the absence of street lights outside, the room is pitch black. I hope Hisao won't bump into something like I did when I nearly knocked over Lilly earlier."

"As the shuffling stops, I move a bit to my right to give him some space. A moment later I hear him get into the bed."
hi "…"
ha "…"
"…"
"This feels awkward."
"I try to make conversation by asking the first question that pops into my mind."
ha "H-Hisao, do you often have trouble sleeping?"
hi "On occasion. It's my medication. It sometimes messes with my sleeping patterns. Sometimes I just wake up in the middle of the night, and sometimes I can't fall asleep no matter how tired I feel."
ha "I'm sorry."
hi "How about you? Do you often have bad dreams?"
ha "S-sometimes. A-about the accident or a-about elementary school. It used to be worse than it is now."
hi "You've been getting better?"
ha "Therapy is helping a bit. Though I still take sleeping pills sometimes during periods when things get especially bad, I'm trying not to rely on them too much."
hi "I met Miss Takawa a few days ago."
ha "I know. She asked me if she could meet you."
hi "She seems nice. A bit odd, but nice."
ha "She… is."
"…"
"Another silence."
"I want to say what's on my mind, but I'm not sure how to put it."
ha "Hisao… How has your h-heart been lately?"
hi "Not bad. I've responded well to those early morning jogs."
ha "Nothing happened like… during… that night?"
"I feel him freezing for a moment."
"We never mentioned “that night” again after we started dating. Even the memory is still painfully awkward for us both."
hi "No… Not even a small flutter. With luck, it'll stay that way."
hi "Look at today. We walked to town and back in warm weather, and we had another long walk this evening. I'm not saying I'm in perfect shape yet, but I'm slowly getting better at handling physical activity."
ha "Because… we're… in a r-relationship right now, but I thought you… were worried about your heart and… erm…"
"I hear him sigh."
"He probably understands where I am going."
hi "You want to know why I picked my own bed if I wasn't worried about my heart."
ha "…we have shared a bed before."
hi "It's pretty confusing, isn't it? We just started dating. We haven't done anything besides kissing and hugging. And yet we've lost our virginity to one another. Sharing a bed shouldn't be a problem, right? We've gone further than just sleeping next to each other."
ha "It… is a bit confusing."
hi "I wasn't sure how you felt about physical intimacy beyond what we've done so far. I don't want to feel the way I felt last time ever again."
ha "I d-don't understand."
"Hisao takes a long pause."
hi "…I feel that last time, sleeping with me was just a means to an end to you. You didn't want the experience itself, you just wanted me to see you in a different light."
hi "I did something to you that you didn't really want. Something very intimate that you didn't really want."
hi "Afterwards, when I learned your motivation, I felt like I had my way with you. Like I took advantage of you."
"I had no idea he felt this bad about it."
"It's true I let him have sex with me, but I didn't feel like he forced me to."
ha "…I… don't really see it that way. I… feel it was me who was t-taking advantage of you."
ha "I had ulterior m-motives I didn't tell you about. At least, not until later."
hi "Even so, the whole thing was painful for you, wasn't it?"
ha "That… last part was kind of painful, to be honest. But…. I've read that… it hurts for most girls during their first time, so I don't think it was your fault."
ha "And there was one thing I enjoyed about the whole thing."
hi "What was that?"
ha "People often recoil when they see even part of my face. You… saw much more of me that night."
ha "But you still… wanted me."
# smooth, hisao
hi "Your scars really don't do much to diminish your beauty, Hanako."
"He says it with such sincerity that I can't help but smile."
"I'm still not quite used to the idea of being attractive to someone, but it always feels good when Hisao is flattering me."
"It makes me want to ease his anxiety in return."
ha "Hisao… What happened that night… It wasn't the right t-time."
ha "But for me, it was at least with the right p-person. I'm happy it was with you."
ha "As awkward as it was, it was with someone I r-really, really liked. That's what's important to me."
ha "So p-please don't feel bad about this anymore."

hi "Hanako… Have you ever thought about… you know… what it'd be like if we went a step further?"
"I feel my cheeks burning when he asks me this question."
"It seems he's trying to find out if I have a sex drive without actually having to ask me directly."
ha "I'm not really sure…"
ha "Not too long ago, I was still considering intimacy something that other people had, but I w-would never have. So I told myself it was something I neither needed nor wanted."
ha "But when you showed me the scar on your chest and allowed me to touch it… I found out I enjoyed the physical contact. It really surprised me when I discovered that aspect of myself."
hi "Was it a pleasant discovery?"
ha "I… don't really know. I'm still in the process of getting used to the idea."
ha "I… do occasionally wonder what it would b-be like if we… became more intimate. But when I think about it for too long, I still get a bit scared."
ha "How about you, Hisao? Aren't you scared you'd get heart trouble if you got too carried away?"
hi "I'm kinda trying to lower the chances of that happening. At this point, I think I should be able to handle something not too intense."
ha "…Are you… proposing something?"
hi "Until now, I simply assumed you weren't up to it anyway, but then I realized I should at least make the effort to ask if you'd like to…"
ha "…l-like to what?"
hi "Like to make out."
"I smile."
"I realize I still come across as fragile and shy despite my new-found resolve to try and become more confident."
"I appreciate the fact Hisao is at least making the effort to find out what I really feel and want instead of making assumptions about me, even if they're probably largely correct."
ha "W-Why so sudden?"
hi "Circumstances, I guess. We have a big room and a big bed all to ourselves right now. The only person within a mile is Lilly, who's a pretty heavy sleeper and isn't going to barge in on us."
hi "We don't get this kind of convenience and privacy at Yamaku. It kinda feels like a shame to waste the opportunity."
hi "But on the other hand, I'd hate to do something you're not ready for… again."
"I take some time to consider Hisao's words."
"I enjoy kissing and hugging him. It turned out that I'm not quite as frightened of physical contact as I'd always thought I'd be. I'm admittedly a bit curious."
"Hisao's right that right now would not be a bad opportunity. The fact that it's too dark for him to actually see me might make me feel more at ease too. But if I want to relax, I have to be sure about one thing."
ha "W-we c-could g-give it a try. But I… I'm not too sure what I… am or am not… ready for."

hi "Any time you feel like it's too much, just pinch my cheek really sharply, and I'll stop right away. Got that?"
ha "Y-yes."
hi "Also, it's probably best if you take the active role."
ha "Ah… M-me t-taking…?"
"Judging from Hisao's tone, he likes that idea, but I'm not so thrilled myself."
"I'm not exactly the most proactive person in the world, and having this rely on me might make for a very passive experience."
"Still, since I was the one who voiced reluctance, it makes sense to do it this way."

"I rest my head on his shoulder, letting his left cheek brush against my own and wait for my heart to stop racing."
"…"
"I'm not sure how long we spend lying like this. Two minutes? Five?"

hi "That feels good, Hanako."
"His encouragement makes me feel a little bit more confident, and I gently lower my head, letting my forehead rest against his."
"As I lightly start stroking his neck with my fingertips, his breathing speeds up ever so slightly, and I let out an awkward giggle as I feel his breath brush across the left side of my face."
"Apparently, Hisao is eager to return the favor as his right hand slides down to the nape of my neck and starts caressing it."
"…"
"This is more comfortable than I thought it'd be."
"…"
"It also feels more intimate than that time we actually had sex."

"After what feels like an hour of petting and caressing, I turn my head to the side."

"This is fun."
"I move my head again to go for his other cheek, but as I bring my lips down again, I'm surprised to find his own meeting me."
"As I quickly move back again, I hear a soft chuckle."
"Determined not to let him catch up to me in this little game of tag, I hold my breath to prevent him from tracking me, then swiftly place a kiss on his right cheek again."
"And then on his left cheek."
"Near his right eyebrow."
"Now he starts holding his breath too to avoid giving himself away, but I won't have any of that."

"And above all… afraid of not being able to enjoy it."
"Before this night, I might have ignored that fear. Last time, me enjoying it wasn't a priority or even a concern for me."
"But now that Hisao has told me how awful he felt afterwards about our last night together, I can't bear to sleep with him under false pretenses again."

"This time, it's much stronger, and I reel from each sensation his hand sends through my abdomen."
"I'm getting so absorbed in the experience that I almost miss him calling out to me."
hi "H-Hanako… ahh… s-stop, stop."
"I quickly let go of him. Judging from his heaving breath, he wouldn't have lasted longer than a few more seconds."
ha "D-do you… hahh… want to take a… hah… break, Hisao?"
hi "I'll take some time to catch my bearings, Hanako. You just lie back and enjoy."

"I start gyrating my sensitive area against his hand."
ha "F-faster… just a little bit."
"I put my hand on his and speed up the pace a bit."
ha "Mmmmmm…"
"He starts kissing my collarbone and left breast."
"I love this."
"I guide his hand to make the strokes shorter and firmer."
ha "H-Hisao… l-like this… ahhh…"
"I don't think I'm going to last much longer. The sensation has grown so overwhelming I can barely think straight."
"My breathing is ragged and shallow."

"As my climax subsides, I become aware of Hisao again who's still rapidly thrusting his hips."
"Eager to let him follow suit, I increase the pace of my strokes even more and gently lick his neck."
"Suddenly, I hear a muffled groan followed by the sensation of something wet hitting my belly."
