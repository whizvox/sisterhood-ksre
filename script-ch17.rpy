n "One more day."
n "As I operate the Brailler in the student council room, my thoughts occasionally drift to last week's events."
n "Hisao was released from the hospital last Saturday and was dropped off at Yamaku by his parents. Hanako had been waiting for him at the gates all morning, but she was afraid to approach him with his parents being present and ran off."
n "Hisao asked Shizune, Misha and me to give his mother and father a tour of the school while he went to do something important. The message was clear: 'Keep them occupied for as long as necessary while I search for Hanako.'"

nvl clear

n "I was heartened and relieved when I received a phone call from Hisao that he hadn't merely succeeded in finding Hanako, but he also managed to reconcile with her. According to Hisao, Hanako was still in the process of recovering from the stress of last week, but he had no doubts that they were going to pick up where they left off."
n "It appears that their relationship is very much like Hanako herself - easy to crack, but impossible to break."
n "Unfortunately, my own relation with Hanako seems a different matter altogether. We're still avoiding each other, and tomorrow evening Akira will arrive here to pick me up."

nvl clear

n "Hisao has assured me that he's been trying to bring the matter up with Hanako, but time seems to be against us. I'd be lying if I denied that the whole situation has left me more than a little bit on edge."
n "When I informed Hanako and Hisao about the fact I'd be leaving, I believed Hanako and I could remain in contact with each other. There's no doubt in my mind, however, that if things don't improve between us before I take my plane, there won't be any more contact. We'll simply go our own way, and that'll be the end of it."
n "I'm not afraid to admit that the idea of Hanako's angry cry to go away and never come back remaining the last words I'll ever hear from her frightens me more than anything else."

mi "It wouldn't be fair of me to hold the delay of last week against you, considering the circumstances, but if you don't want to be remembered as the black sheep among the class representatives, you'd better make sure to have everything wrapped up before you leave."

"I let out a frustrated sigh before I can stop myself."
"Last week has been strange for Shizune and me."
"During our student council days, I always had the impression that Shizune only concerned herself with other people when it benefitted her own goals in some way or another, but that impression had come under fire when I witnessed Shizune's actions last week."
"Both Shizune and Misha probably realized that the matter between Hisao and Hanako wasn't their business to get involved in, so they went out of their way to help Hisao in whatever small ways they could and created a sort of temporary truce between us."
"While leading Hisao's parents around, both of us took turns explaining different things to them and talking about various aspects of life at Yamaku, and I was surprised that for once, we worked together well."
"However, when she learned that Hisao and Hanako reconciled, she immediately closed off that particular chapter, and when I showed up at the student council room this afternoon, she wasted no time in complaining about me not showing up sooner as if nothing had happened."
li "I can assure you I will have all paperwork done before the deadline of tomorrow. That should be all that matters."
li "Or are you now concerned with other things besides cold, hard results all of a sudden?"
"And here I am taking the bait again."
"I'm not sure why I can't take Shizune's provocations with a grain of salt like Hisao seems able to do without any significant effort. Perhaps the fact that we're family makes it more difficult to back down."

mi "If you have a secret plan to speed up the process, I'll be more than happy to witness it, though I won't hold out hope that you're going to surprise me."
li "People can still surprise each other on occasion, Shizune."
li "I must admit I was somewhat surprised by the efforts you made to help Hisao and Hanako through last week. Your actions were most certainly appreciated."

mi "I'm offended by the fact you were surprised. Hisao and Hanako are still members of my class. Just because I run my class in a different way than you do, doesn't mean I can't do my part to help my classmates when emergencies take place."
mi "I may be a dictator in your eyes, but I like to think of myself as a responsible one."
"Despite Shizune's retort being very much an accusation, I smile a little bit."
"I have to admit she did act responsibly. It seems Hisao wasn't exaggerating when he said he considered Shizune and Misha friends despite their occasional pushiness."
li "I realize you don't value my opinion very much, but I don't think it would hurt if your classmates were to witness that responsible streak a little more often."
"It might make them more willing to voluntarily lend you a hand on occasion without having to be pressured into it."

mi "The approach you suggest is overrated. People will always get to tasks more quickly if you direct them properly. My goal isn't to win a popularity contest, but to keep my class functioning smoothly."

mi "Hey, what's in the envelopes, Lilly?"
li "The envelopes contain all the remaining paperwork that still had to be done before the start of summer break."
li "It turned out that while I was occupied with Hisao and Hanako last week, several of my classmates took it upon themselves to fill out all the remaining forms for me on their own in an attempt to make things easier for me and presumably also as a gesture of support and appreciation."
li "They did this without me even having to ask them. All that remained for me to do was to type up a small summary."
li "Do you not agree with me that no class is running more smoothly than a class where the representative can afford to take an unexpected leave of absence, and things still get done on a timely basis?"
