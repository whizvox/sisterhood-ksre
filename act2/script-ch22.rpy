        n "{vspace=60}The room I've woken up in reminds me more of a hotel room, with its large bed, a small table with two chairs near one corner and a doorway leading to a niche with a sink and a small shower stall inside, than an ordinary bedroom."
        n "The curtains in front of the window facing the bed are still closed, but judging from the amount of light they're letting through, it's definitely not morning anymore. The dim light and the pleasant temperature give the room a cozy feeling."
        n "For as long as I've known her, Lilly has always carried herself with a certain air of nobility, and when she shelled out a whopping 20,000 yen for Hanako's birthday present without a moment of hesitation, it merely confirmed my suspicions that Lilly came from a family that could be categorized as upper class."
        n "The fact that her family owned a summer home and didn't seem to mind paying for two intercontinental flight tickets changed my expectations from ‘not strapped for cash’ to ‘rich’. Still, when Akira dropped us off at the Satou family's residence, I was taken aback by the size of the building. I think the word ‘mansion’ would not be an exaggeration."

        "The long journey here had left the three of us so extremely exhausted that after Akira bid us farewell, we pretty much went to bed immediately without waiting for Lilly's parents to come home."
        "I look at the chairs in the corner again. My own clothes are folded over one of them. The other holds Hanako's clothes."
        "I softly turn my head to the right, and I can see my girlfriend lying next to me. She's currently lying on her stomach and seems occupied scribbling words onto a small blocknote in front of her."
        "Since she's not wearing her hair clip, and a lock of hair is obscuring the right side of her face, it appears she hasn't noticed me waking up yet."
        "With the covers on her side of the bed pulled back and with nothing on except her panties and a T-shirt, Hanako is a pleasant sight to wake up to."
        "Taking care not to alert her, I sneak a hand over to the left side of her lower back and playfully tickle the exposed skin there."
