        "She doesn't react immediately, and for a second I believe she's not going for it. Then she furiously starts rubbing and I firmly grab hold of her buttocks with both hands and start thrusting again."

        "The sight of Hanako in front of me, the wonderful sensation that runs through me with each movement of my hips..."
        "The sound of our heavy breathing, even the sound of my body slapping against hers (which we usually find embarassing) all combine to push us towards our rapidly approaching climax."
        "Shaking the last few shreds of embarassment from my mind, I give in to lust and give us the final push towards the inevitable."

        "The combination of the wine slightly dulling my sense of balance and the first jolt that surges through my groin makes my knees buckle and I collapse on top of Hanako, pinning her underneath me."
        "I'm already too caught up in the moment to get back into position and simply keep thrusting for as long as the waves of extacy are coursing through my body."
        "I'm only vaguely aware of Hanako underneath me suddenly crying out, tensing up and bucking her hips several times."

        "When my body finally relaxes, I make a half-hearted attempt to get up, only to experience a sudden spell of dizziness."

        "Being unable to muster the willpower to do anything other than lie back down and cling to the girl sharing the bed with me, my wandering hand manages to find the bedsheet that I quickly pull over us."
        "As our bodies settle down from our act of passion, a mixture of weariness and bliss washes over me."

        "Before I give in to the sense of drowsiness, one last thought passes through my mind."

        "This is heaven!"
