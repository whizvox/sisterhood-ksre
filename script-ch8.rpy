"In a way, it was a pretty clever idea on Hisao's part."
"While there are quite a few people around, the hall itself is rather dark so my scarring isn't very noticeable, especially since I'm also wearing my hat. And while we're playing games, there's no need for small talk."

ha "It was pretty popular with the other kids, so I didn't get around to using it very often."
"We clear the roof of the truck. Now what?"
hi "They have a retro section here as well. We could check it out later. We might run into some familiar titles."

"One is the arcade cabinet we were standing in front of with a big \"GAME OVER\" message on the screen."
"The other is my boyfriend, also kneeling on the floor and looking at the screen, then looking at me."
